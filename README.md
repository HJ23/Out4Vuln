### Out4Vuln  (*Under maintainence*)
Web vulnerability scanner and OSINT tool.
---

Out4Vuln is a basic web application vulnerability scanner written from scratch. It employs older projects of mine [ Raptor ](https://github.com/HJ23/Raptor) and UrlGatherer.

Still improving its functionalities and adding new modules to make it more capable. This scanner consists of
two main components OSINT finder and Vulnerability finder.

OSINT finder uses different API's as well as free resources to identify attack surface.

On the other hand Vulnerability finder fuzz's for vulnerabilities.

For better results I highly encourage you to get API keys.
